    # i could have simply used a constructor over here but use krne ke liye hame values pata honi chahiye jo ham fields me pass krenge.
    # but, idhr toh malum hii nai hai kya values present hai json file mei.. so simply read them first and then constructor use kro. Thats the idea
    # Thus, i wrote a class method which internally uses the constructor (cls).
